# Homemade Chess AI

This is a complete chess game I wrote from scratch in Java, using OpenGL for rendering.  
Everything from the board logic to the graphics engine and the AI opponent is built by me without relying on external libraries for chess rules or AI logic.

## The Challenge
I set myself a personal challenge:

- **No research. No tutorials. No existing AI implementations.**  
- I had to design my own approach to chess AI purely with logic, experimentation, and creativity.  

The result is an AI that can comfortably beat most casual players. It doesnâ€™t follow standard chess engine design patterns, but instead uses ideas I came up with on my own.

## Features
- Play against an AI opponent or watch it play itself  
- Full chess rules implemented (including castling, en passant, and promotion)  
- OpenGL rendering for 3D visuals  
- Custom-built chess AI from scratch
